# Three.js Portfolio Demo

In this project we have made a portfolio demo with **Three.js ‚Äì JavaScript 3D Library**

For this project we have used Vite.

**Vite is framework-agnostic and works with multiple frameworks. For instance, it offers official templates for React, Vue, Preact, Svelte, Lit and even vanilla JavaScript and TypeScript. It offers multi-page support.**

* We have also used Vanilla JavaScript framework for our project.

**Vite. js is a rapid development tool for modern web projects. It focuses on speed and performance by improving the development experience. Vite uses native browser ES imports to enable support for modern browsers without a build process.**
